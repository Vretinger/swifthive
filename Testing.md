## Responsiveness Testing

The SwiftHive website was tested on a variety of devices and screen sizes using browser developer tools and real devices. The layout, content, and functionality adapt well to different screen sizes thanks to the use of Bootstrap grid systems and responsive design techniques.

## Browser Compatibility Testing

The website was tested on the following browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari (MacOS)
- Samsung Internet (Mobile)

All major features work consistently across these browsers.

## Device Testing

Real device testing was performed on the following devices:
- Windows Desktop
- MacBook (13‚Äù)
- Samsung Galaxy S21
- iPhone XR
- iPad

Each view was validated to ensure elements render correctly and all buttons and links function as expected.

## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

Validated using W3C Markup Validation Service. No major errors were found.

### CSS Validation

Custom CSS was validated using W3C CSS Validator. Minor warnings related to Bootstrap overrides were noted but did not affect performance.


### Python

Python code was validated using flake8. Minor line-length warnings were handled by refactoring where necessary, or justified where clarity was improved.

## Bugs
